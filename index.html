          <h1>What Does Nonbinary Mean?</h1>
        </center>
          <p>
            Non-binary gender identity is just one term used to describe individuals
             who may experience a gender identity that is neither exclusively male
             or female or is in between or beyond both genders.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Note: Non-binary
             individuals may identify as gender fluid, agender (without gender),
             third gender, or something else entirely

          Hello Reader,
          <br/>
          The name of the project “We the People” is a nod to the first lines of
          the Constitution because nonbinary people have been outcasted for who
          they are even though they are people. It is important to learn about
          things you don’t understand. As humans, we tend to fear what we don’t
          understand. So we respond with aggression. You don’t need to agree
          with everything that is stated in this project but try and keep an
          open mind. I chose nonbinary people because it’s something that I
          didn’t have much knowledge about and I wanted to know more about
          them.  How do nonbinary people challenge societal gender norms?
          Nonbinary people challenge societal gender norms by making gender
          a spectrum instead of binary. In this project, you will arguments
          for both why gender is a spectrum and why it isn’t but also
          you see these people as what they are. People who are living
          their lives.

          What surprised me the most was the information I learn and who is
          actually nonbinary. Which is pretty cool to find out. Like Gerard Way
          who was the lead singer for My Chemical Romance. I knew almost nothing
          about nonbinary people and I wanted to learn more about them. The more
          I did research the more I understood. I learned that nonbinary people
          have been around for a long time. And I understood how people associate
          gender with sex. And since there are only 2 sexes(male, female) there
          must only be 2 genders. I also understand that the argument isn’t “is
          gender a spectrum” it’s more about the definition of what gender is.
          People who argue that gender is a spectrum is using gender as to how
          you present you socially and in society. But people who argue that
          gender isn’t a spectrum is using gender as a synonym for sex. Synonym
          I learned that everything that I did wasn’t too far off to base on
          what I’ve done previously. For example, I did a compare and contrast
          essay, and all the steps I’ve done for a research essay still apply to
          the essay. The only thing that was different was that I was showing 2
          different sides for the same coin which was something new for me.
          My weakest parts of the project would have to be my podcast and video
          since I couldn’t really film my video or do my podcast because I ran
          out of time. I also couldn’t find a subject for my video and I couldn’t
          get people together for the podcast. I think my strength would be my
          compare and contrast essay but even then it’s below average at that. I
          only deserve maybe a 1.5 on the project as a whole. The thought was
          there but it wasn’t executed properly.
