            In our world,it seems like there has been a boom of people coming out
            as a multitude of things. They are part of the LGBTQ+ community:
            lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer+. The debate is over the
            “Q+” in the LGBTQ+. Are there more than 2 genders, is gender a
            spectrum?
            <br/>
             If gender is a spectrum, you could break it down into 5 different
             genders in its most basic form.  At the ends of the spectrum, there
             are male and female, they are also known as 1st gender. The third
             gender can be described as a feminine male. The 4th gender can be
             described as a masculine female. 5th gender in the middle of male
             and female.
             <br/>
             The main argument that has been made is that, if you are a male you
             have XY chromosomes and if you are a female you have XX chromosomes.
             With that ideology that excludes intersex people who have both male
             and female anatomy to varying degrees. There was a boom of intersex
             people in the 1880s and that was the introduction of the binary
             system. Doctors started pressuring people to have unnecessary
             surgeries to either be male or female.1 There have been examples of
             nonbinary people in history and religion.
             <br/>
             Some Native American tribes had a multigender system, they have a
             ceremony that had children at the age of 8 to choose a basket or a
             bow. This would decide what they would for the rest of their life.
             If a child who was born a male chose the basket they were given a
             new name and female clothes and vise versa for a child who as born
             a girl and picked up the bow. In India, there is a term called Hijra.
             Which is the third gender, they believe a true hijra lacks a penis
             and scrotum and some have surgery to remove them. In Indonesia,
             they have a term called bissu, which is the 5th gender. This happens
             to someone when they learn a language through their dreams. Some
             believe that a true bissu don’t menstruate or get an erection.
             Because bissu have both masculine and feminine sides of the
             spectrum they are allowed to be possessed by dewata(gods).
             <br/>
             On the other side of the spectrum, you could argue that gender isn’t
             a spectrum, that gender is binary. You could argue that just because
             1% of the population is intersex doesn’t mean that gender is a
             spectrum. “There exist individuals who possess fewer or more than
             10 digits on their hands, but this hasn’t called for a
             re-conceptualization of how many fingers a human being has.”
             Transgender people change their sex to the opposite gender
             still making gender binary and not a spectrum. Because of this
             rising culture of the gender spectrum, you have stories like David
             Reimer.
             <br/>
             Reimer was a subject of an experiment in the 60s. He was raised as
             a girl and was put on female hormones. Doctors wanted to prove that
             feminine or masculine isn’t genetic, but that it is a social
             construct. But after learning that he was a male, he wanted to go
             back to his male identity. Sadly after all of his hardships, he
             committed suicide at the age of 38. 3 Saying that gender is a
             spectrum just causes confusion for the public and stories like
             David Reimer.

            The compare and contrast essay shows why gender is a spectrum and
            why it isn’t spectrum with valid points on both sides. The purpose
            was to debate the gender spectrum theory and show different
            perspectives. The audience is for people who debate if gender is a
            spectrum or not.  The resources I used the following: Gender
            Spectrum Theory by Angela Tharp, Science Shows Sex Is Binary, Not a
            Spectrum by Debra Soh, and David Riemer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan
            Case by New York Times. There were used for direct quotes.
