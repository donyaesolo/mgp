            Scott Duane is a transgender man and he lives in Oakland California.
            Along with advocating for the LGBT community, he is a software engineer
            in San Fransisco. Micah Rajunov is a nonbinary person living in Boston
            with their spouse before working in San Fransisco. They have had other
            works published such as “Engaging Transgender Patients: Using Social
            Media to Inform Medical Practice and Research in Transgender Health.”
            and have been interviews for publications in the New York Times.
            <br/>
            They are both strong advocates for the LGBT community and writing a
            first-person novel about the experiences of Nonbinary people to the
            general public as a way to educate people.
            <br/>
            Nonbinary: Memoirs of Gender and Identity gives a first-person
            experience of exploring gender identity. Over the course of the book,
            you go through a journey of what one would experience when question
            their identity. You question yourself almost shy, then you evolve to
            be proud of yourself, then you have a sense of community, a safe space.
            Then it finally crescendos in the discussion of trans rights and the
            age-old question “Are there multiple genders?”
            <br/>
            There are 5 different of the book respectfully named: What is gender?,
            Visibility: Standing Up and Standing Out, Community: Creating a place
            for the rest of us, Trans Enough: Representation and differentiation,
            and Redefining Dualities Paradoxes and possibilities of gender. I
            would recommend this book to someone who just wants more insight
            into the world of nonbinary people.

          <p>
            Literature Review does a review of the book Noninary: Memoirs of
            Gender and Identity. The purpose was to share the stories of nonbinary
            people. The audience is Ill-informed people and LGBTQ+ supporters.
            The resources I used the following: Noninary: Memoirs of Gender and
            Identity. There were used for direct quotes.
