            The podcast was going to be a debate about the gender spectrum theory.
            It was going to be with Me, Veronica, and Rachel

            Podcast has a discussion about gender. The purpose is to have a
            discussion. The audience is people on both sides of the spectrum,
             people who support LGBTQ+ people and people who donâ€™t. The resources
             I would have used are the following: Rachel, Veronica,
             RealClearPolitics, Gender Spectrum. They were going to be used to
             have a discussion.
